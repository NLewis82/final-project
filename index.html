        <p> I started my YouTube channel back in May 28th in 2015 and I've working on it for seven years now, I have 657 videos (with more videos coming) and 306 subscribers and I make content about my creation called The Teeen Gang. </p> 
        <p> The Teen Gang is a group of five anthropromorphic cat teenagers with special powers and they live a city called Teensville City. </p>
        <p> My YouTube channel name is LongHairedGIRL2000 and the meaning behind is that I really, really, really long hair and I was born in the year 2000 and I'm a girl. </p>
        <p> I created my YouTube channel before my grandma unexpectedly passed away later on in November in 2015. </p> 
        <p> The Teen Gang was inspired by three minature stuffed animal toys I used to play with wen I was a toldder and also their inspired by my love for cats. </p>
